## Overview
This project aims to detect face spoofing attacks in real-time using advanced computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms. The system captures video frames from a webcam, detects faces, and identifies spoofing attempts using features like heat maps, Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), occlusion detection, and ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF).

## Features Used
- *Heat Map*: Generates heat maps to identify spoofing based on temperature differences.
- *LBP (Local Binary Patterns)*: Extracts texture features from face images.
- *HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)*: Extracts gradient orientation features to detect spoofing.
- *Occlusion Detection*: Identifies occluded regions in face images to detect spoofing attempts.
- *ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)*: Detects key points and computes descriptors for face images.

## Setup and Installation
1. *Clone the Repository*:
    sh
    git clone https://github.com/dead10GOD/Anti_Spoofing_System.git
    cd AntiSpoofing
    
2. *Install Dependencies*:
    Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:
    sh
    pip install numpy opencv-python scikit-learn
    

## Key Concepts and Theory
### Heat Map
Generates heat maps to identify spoofing based on temperature differences between real faces and spoofed images.

### Local Binary Patterns (LBP)
LBP is a simple and efficient texture descriptor that labels the pixels of an image by thresholding the neighborhood of each pixel and considers the result as a binary number.

### Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
HOG is a feature descriptor used in computer vision and image processing for the purpose of object detection. It counts occurrences of gradient orientation in localized portions of an image.

### Occlusion Detection
Detects occluded regions in face images to identify potential spoofing attempts.

### ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)
ORB is a key point detector and descriptor extraction technique that is used for object recognition and computer vision tasks.

## Applications
- *Security Systems*: Enhance security by detecting spoofing attempts in real-time.
- *Authentication*: Improve the reliability of face recognition systems by preventing spoofing attacks.

## Advantages
- *Real-Time Processing*: Immediate detection of spoofing attempts.
- *High Accuracy*: Robust detection of real vs. spoofed faces using multiple features.
- *Scalability*: Expand the dataset and models to improve detection performance.
